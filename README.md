# Welcome to URC4ESH

This prototypical implementation will show the transfer of URC (Universal Remote Console) to the Eclipse Smart Home project. URC4SH combines three technologies:
* Eclipse Smart Home (ESH)
* Universal Remote Console (URC)
 * OpenAPE

## ESH and URC
The Idea of URC is to provide personalized and pluggable user interfaces to all kind of electronic devices and services to support people with their individual needs and preferences.
URC4ESH will show how the main concepts of URC can be transfered to mainstream platforms such as Eclipse Smart Home/OpenHAB. Therefore no changes to the Eclipse Smart Home platform are made. URC4ESH is adding some additional OSGi components.

## URC4ESH and OpenAPE
OpenAPE is an infrastructure to exchange context information across platforms to provide information that are required to adjust user interfaces to the users individual neds and preferences.
